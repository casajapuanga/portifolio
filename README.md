Portifolio of main activities held by Casa Japuanga, since it's creation on 2010

About Us:
Casa Japuanga (formerly Project Alberto Seabra 1128) is an experience in developing an intentional urban community, which emerged from the proposal to transform the intimate space of the house, commonly used as a place of residence and retreat, into a place of coexistence, experimentation, and transformation, through transdisciplinary events involving art, gastronomy, and education for the community. This initiative started in 2010 and is currently being applied and developed.

We present the phases that mark its development process:

1st phase [2010 - 2013] - The house - The project: The use of the house as a space for creation and experimentation. The idea of a productive house arises. The house, still as an intimate space, opens its doors to welcome people, ideas, and processes.

2nd phase [2014-2016] - House-project: The consolidation of the project and the use of the house as a territory for its realization. The idea of a collective and productive house emerges. Support from the Ministry of Culture and funding through sponsorship. With the resource, it was possible to exponentially expand the network of relationships and the extended community beyond the residents. The emergence of new collective houses and autonomous spaces is observed, as well as the recognition of existing collective houses or similar projects.

3rd phase [2017-2019] - Consolidation of the house as an urban community and as an autonomous cultural territory: The transformed house is the project itself. At this stage, the Japuanga Collective is created, a group formed by residents, former residents, and frequent visitors of the house, who participate in the co-creation of the space's activities. There are already more than 50 people who have passed through the house and a large network of relationships with collaborators and frequent visitors. A relevant data is the social networks, with more than 1500 followers on Instagram and more than 1500 followers on Facebook.

The House is understood as an Autonomous Cultural Territory, which has a decentralized management, organically structured from the meeting between the skills of the residents and the extended community. Casa Japuanga is part of the Oceano Cultural network, which connects more than 150 autonomous cultural spaces in the city of São Paulo.

4th Phase [2020-2021] - pandemic times
the house closes to the public and intensifies the community process inside. With the support of an emergency law, we managed to maintain the equipment and spaces of the house and conduct some online events. The dialogue with the Oceano Cultural network intensifies, discussing public policies to encourage autonomous spaces and designing collaborative projects for emergency actions and future plans.

5th Phase [2022- 2023] - reopen and flirting with Web3
the house reopens its doors to the public, hosting cultural events. A period of great circulation of residents, from various regions of the country. During this period, we received the current Minister of Indigenous Peoples, Sônia Guajajara, holding the pre-launch of her candidacy for the community of cultural houses and social agents in the region.
2022 - we hosted three events related to the NEAR Blockchain, through the actions of Nomade Label DAO (NEAR Protocol), managing a resource of 1100 USD for a total of 10 artists.

Dreaming Futures [2024 - 2027] - Onboarding Web 3 - Dapp - DAO
2024 - Web 3 onboarding
2025 - develop Community Dapp [marketplace of products and services]
2026-27 - develop Decentralized Governance Forum on blockchain 

The community's interest in Web3 technology lies in the possibilities of developing decentralized governance that can intensify the already developed processes, generating more community engagement and aiming at the sustainability of the community within the principles of the creative economy.

Our first and greatest challenge is to educate the community for Web3, and the chosen path is the implementation of the JapuHUB project, through the realization of 4 transdisciplinary events of art, technology, and community processes in the house space, distributed over 1 year, attracting artists, enthusiasts, and the community to the affective onboarding process through the worldapp, instituting <WLD> as the community's currency, and using World ID technology as a guarantee of non-duplication of transactions.

Activities developed by current residents and members of the Japuanga community:
artistic performances (dance, experimental music, Brazilian music, law, consulting on cultural projects and community processes, music lessons, training course for pilotage competition, text revision, soundtrack composition, Portuguese-Spanish translation, carbon credit analysis, waste management program, composting, urban permaculture, literary creation, cultural production, audiovisual production, gastronomy and cooking, carpentry, tattooing, bicycle workshop, creativity courses.
